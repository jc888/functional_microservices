    "description": "<p>This talk follows on from @cullophid&#39;s session and seeks to build on those foundations with larger abstractions that can help developers to avoid common pitfalls when writing JavaScript such as null references (<code>Maybe</code>s), uncaught exceptions (<code>Either</code>s) and asynchronous control flow (<code>Future</code>s). These abstractions help to encapsulate uncertainty allowing us to code the happy path whilst ultimately enforcing the handling of error conditions and as the data types all share a common interface it allows us to compose them in predictable ways.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Stefano Vozza is a tech lead at Trinity Mirror and has a keen interest in functional programming, DevOps and continuous delivery.

    "title": "Write More Resilient JavaScript with Flow",
    "description": "<p><strong>Abstract</strong>&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Flow is a static type checker for JavaScript (an otherwise dynamically-typed language). You can think of it as a productivity tool that catches common errors <em>before</em> they run. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Take the infamous &quot;&#39;Undefined&#39; is not a function&quot; error as an example. When writing vanilla JavaScript, you would have to wait until runtime to receive this arduous error. Flow - on the other hand - integrates with your favorite editor and analyzes the correctness of your code as you write it. If you were to reference a non-existent function, Flow would not only tell you immediately but also provide additional context that makes the error easier to fix.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Whilst Flow is predominantly used with front-end technologies like React, I have been using it with great success for my Node.js projects and in this talk, I&#39;ll not only show you how to get up and running with Flow, I&#39;ll also share my experience with you. I&#39;ll also take a moment at the end of my talk to touch on the differences between Flow and TypeScript.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;<strong>Alex Booker</strong>&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Alex Booker is a Developer Advocate at <a href=\"https://pusher.com/\">Pusher</a>.

This probably left a bitter taste in your mouth, especially when things went wrong.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Those in the industry have been working hard to sweeten the deal again - efforts have been made to bring WebRTC into the mainstream and as a result the technology is experiencing a rebirth. Thanks to those who have remained dedicated to improving the situation for those around them, WebRTC is finally starting to fulfil the original expectations that were had of it. Both the technology and the support networks have been built up to make experimenting with it again a pleasure, not a pain.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;WebRTC has grown up; in this talk you will learn how far along the tech has come, its current capabilities, the amazing things that people are starting to do with it, and how simple getting started with the new toolsets available.&#13;&#10;</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>You&#39;ve heard of TypeScript, but you&#39;re not sure if it&#39;s a good idea, and you&#39;ve never really seen it in action. TypeScript is powerful though, rapidly gaining momentum, and has a lot more to offer than just JS + classes. Let&#39;s take a proper look.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In this talk, we&#39;ll dig a bit deeper and play around with some of the more interesting features TypeScript gives you. We&#39;ll walk through the extras that TypeScript provides and how they&#39;ll solve your every woe, learn a bit about where the types come in and why you care, and see how exactly you might put it into action on your next Node project.</p>\n",
